				<p class="desc-pa">Mangkuk offers delightful smoothies that aim to ensure everyone healthy consumption. Our mission is to provide the best solution for people to improve their lives without any drastic changes. We also believe that cultivating an environment is an effective way to get started. Our community is our priority. In order to make this happen, we help people from tutorial to food delivery and booking our place to applying for jobs. These services have positive impacts on our community on so many levels. Food delivery plays a vital role in our services because it helps people enjoy our smoothies at any time and place. On the other hand, recipes are necessary for exposure to smoothies as people can experience the process of creating a smoothie. Since our facility provides a comfortable environment and equipment is quality, we decide to make them available for booking that can be used for event purposes. Jobs define us as a whole community of Mangkuk; managers, chefs, cashiers, and janitors contribute to Mangkukâ€™s growth and all people, especially our beloved customers. </p>
